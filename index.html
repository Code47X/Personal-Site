                Hey there! My name is <span style="color:#FCB64D;">Tanner Hartwig</span>. I'm an aspiring software engineer and web developer. Programming has always been a passion of mine, and I strive to learn the ins and outs of programming in a variety of fields. Everything from data mining and web development to mobile application and game development has hooked my intrest (more of an obsession at this point). I believe programming is both a science and an art, a perfect blend of artistic freedom and logical analysis; A truly powerful skill one can learn in a matter of days, yet spend a lifetime mastering. It's this mastery I strive to achieve. Reading page after page of framework docs and looking at the same code for hours on end trying to find that bug caused by an unfortunate typo (We've all been there, ahhhh!) are a few of the occourances that just reinforce me on my path to mastery. However, even the most dedicated developers need their breaks. When I'm not programming I'm most likely out playing basketball or gaming with friends. On particularly hot days I love floating the San Marcos river, there's just something so relaxing about it. Well, that's a pretty broad stroke of who I am. Feel free to continue reading if you want to know more!

                I transfered from Lousiana State University to Texas State University in 2011. I studied computer science here for 2 years here before moving to Chicago for the Dev Bootcamp program. Upon graduatuation from Dev Bootcamp, I decided to move back to Texas and work on finishing my bachelor of science. This is where I currently reside, continualy working towards my degree. I've taken many cool cources here, such as game development, assembley language, and data structures. In addition to my computer science degree, I'm also working towards a minor in applied mathmatics. I've learned so much at Texas State and look forward to graduation.

                I got accepted to Dev Bootcamp in Chicago near the end of 2013. Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week intensive program designed to teach students the skills and tools used by professional developers. This was one of the best experences of my life; I learned so much about web development while there. The Ruby on Rails framework, test driven development, agile methodologies, and git source control are just of the few of the things DBC taught me. I graduated DBC in December of last year, and would easly recommend it to anyone intrested in web development. Dev Bootcamp was an instrumental step on my path to becoming a professional developer!

            <h4> Gottman Relationship Survey </h4>
            <p>
                Our team of 5 Dev Bootcamp students were asked by The Gottman Institute to take their 200 page, proprietary relationship survey and transform it into a sleek and efficient web application. This application takes the user through the survey one section at a time, and sends the calculated results to their clinician upon completion. An administrator control pannel was also designed, which allows an admin to accept new clinicians to the network and freeze current accounts if necessary. This web app will be used by hundreds of clinicians in the Gottman's network to help diagnose and treat patients relationships. Security and privacy were big areas of concentration due to the nature of the survey. Techologies used included Ruby on Rails, RSpec, BCrypt, Bootstrap, and many others.
